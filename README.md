MD Assistant builds upon the solid foundation of VaultMate with specific enhancements for power users:

### ✨ New Functionalities
*   **📝 Memos Widget**: A dedicated widget to view and quickly capture thoughts.
    *   **Quick Capture**: Tap `+` on the widget to open a lightweight, transparent input dialog without fully opening the app.
    *   **Auto-Timestamp**: Automatically appends entries with `- HH:mm Content` format to your daily note.
    *   **Smart Refresh**: Widget updates instantly after adding a memo.
    *   **Variable Support**: Support dynamic paths like `{{YYYY}}/{{YYYY-MM-DD}}.md`.
*   **🔍 Enhanced Task Widget**: 
    *   **Filter Support**: Apply saved filters directly to your home screen task widgets.
    *   **Dynamic Title**: Widget title reflects filter status (e.g. "Tasks" vs "Today tasks").
