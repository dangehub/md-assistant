## 🚀 Features

VaultMate fills the gap between a simple to-do app and the powerful Obsidian knowledge base.

* **⚡ Seamless Integration:** Works directly with your local markdown files. No proprietary database, no vendor lock-in.
* **✅ Advanced Task Management:**
    * Parse `- [ ]` tasks automatically from your notes.
    * Support for `#tags` and priorities.
    * Clean, mobile-optimized UI for checking off items.
* **🎨 Home Screen Widgets:** Interactive widgets for iOS and Android. View tasks and quick notes without opening the app.
* **🔌 Plugin Compatibility:** Fully compatible with Obsidian Tasks, NoteTask, and Reminder plugins.
* **🔒 Privacy First:** Your data never leaves your device (unless you sync via iCloud/FolderSync). No analytics, no tracking.
* **🌓 Dark Mode:** Fully optimized for late-night productivity.
